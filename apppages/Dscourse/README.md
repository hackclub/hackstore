Learn and master the most common data structures in this full course from Google engineer William Fiset. This course teaches data structures to beginners using high quality animations to represent the data structures visually.

You will learn how to code various data structures together with simple to follow step-by-step instructions. Every data structure presented will be accompanied by some working source code (in Java) to solidify your understanding.

## Why learn Data structure

As applications are getting complex and data rich, there are three common problems that applications face now-a-days.

- Data Search − Consider an inventory of 1 million(106) items of a store. If the application is to search an item, it has to search an item in 1 million(106) items every time slowing down the search. As data grows, search will become slower.

- Processor speed − Processor speed although being very high, falls limited if the data grows to billion records.

- Multiple requests − As thousands of users can search data simultaneously on a web server, even the fast server fails while searching the data.

To solve the above-mentioned problems, data structures come to rescue. Data can be organized in a data structure in such a way that all items may not be required to be searched, and the required data can be searched almost instantly.
