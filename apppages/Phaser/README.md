**Phaser** is a free software 2D game framework for making HTML5 games for desktop and mobile.It is developed by Photon Storm.

Phaser uses both a Canvas and WebGL renderer internally and can automatically swap between them based on browser support.This allows for fast rendering across desktop and mobile. It uses the Pixi.js library for rendering.

Games can be compiled to iOS, Android and native desktop apps via 3rd party tools like Apache Cordova and phonegap.

Whilst you can wrap your game into a native app using tools such as Cordova and Phonegap the game itself is never compiled._The 'game' is simply run as JavaScript in a bundled browser._ This means performance is nothing like a native compiled app.
