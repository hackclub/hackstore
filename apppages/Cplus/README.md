C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This C++ tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of C++ for beginners to advanded software engineers.

C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.

## Why to Learn C++

C++ is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C++:

- C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development.

- C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.

- C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers. If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work.

- C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest of software development.

- C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.

There are 1000s of good reasons to learn C++ Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn any programming language, not only C++, you just need to code, and code and finally code until you become expert.
