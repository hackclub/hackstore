Node.js is a very powerful JavaScript-based platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine. It is used to develop I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites, single-page applications, and other web applications. Node.js is open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world.

## Features of Node.js

Following are some of the important features that make Node.js the first choice of software architects.

- Asynchronous and Event Driven − All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.

* Very Fast − Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.

* Single Threaded but Highly Scalable − Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests. Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.

* No Buffering − Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.

- License − Node.js is released under the MIT license.

* Where to Use Node.js?

Following are the areas where Node.js is proving itself as a perfect technology partner.

- I/O bound Applications
- Data Streaming Applications
- Data Intensive Real-time Applications (DIRT)
- JSON APIs based Applications
- Single Page Applications
