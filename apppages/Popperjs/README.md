Popper.js is a positioning engine, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element to make it possible to position it near a given reference element.

The engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as modifiers (similar to middlewares or plugins).
The whole code base is written in ES2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to SauceLabs and TravisCI.

Popper.js has zero dependencies. No jQuery, no LoDash, nothing.
It's used by big companies like Twitter in Bootstrap v4, Microsoft in WebClipper and Atlassian in AtlasKit.
