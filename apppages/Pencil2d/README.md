## History

The original version of the software was formerly called it's Pencil, created by Pascal Naidon and Patrick Corrieri in 2006, but was abandoned and discontinued in 2009. After the original authors abandoned the project, forks allowed it to continue. It was used in 2013 by the authors of the Morevna Project, a cartoon project under a free license.

The project then continues on the pencil2D.org site. in spring 2019, changes are made to the organization of updates, with the deletion of the CR, not used and more regular updates whose version numbers are even with patches, and more occasionally, odd versions adding features. The goal is to quickly fix bugs as soon as they appear, rather than letting them accumulate, and to offer stability fixes more quickly. It starts with version 0.6.4, released in May 2019. The developers are also setting up a project upload page in order to establish a library of tests for debugging and validity tests.
