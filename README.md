This is the documentation of **Hack Store and is under development.**
You can visit Hack Store at <a href="https://hackstore.hackclub.com/" >https://hackstore.hackclub.com/</a>. **It is an online dummy version of the software interface.**

## What is Hack Store?

Hack store is a web interface that contains a collection of educational resources. Hack Store is part of **Hack Box** , which is an initiative to provide free-of-cost resources to the **most remote places of the world without the requirement of the internet connectivity.**

## How will this thing work?

Okay, so we said it will provide all of its resources offline and you are wondering how?

<img src="public/readme/how.webp"  alt="How GIF"/>
<br/>
<br/>

We will be shipping all of these software **inside an SD card which will contain Raspberry OS system image (it will have Hack Store server pre-installed in it)** and once it will be plugged in a Raspberry Pi ,Hack Store will be **available to everyone who will be connected to the same wifi network** on which the Raspberry Pi is running.

Once you have plugged in the sd card just go to your browser and type http://box.local and if that doesn't work then try http://ipaddressofraspberrypi, here ipaddressofraspberrypi is the ipadress of the Raspberry Pi on which the server is running!

## How will people recieve updates?

Once we ship the SD card with Hack Store in it, **We will be maintaining an online website where the latest SD card image will be available**, someone in the place (we will be shipping sd cards to places with very less access to the the internet) who has access to the the internet can download it with a download manager over a phase of time and then can boot the sd card with new system Image which will give them access to new updates.
